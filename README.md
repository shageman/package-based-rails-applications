# Source Code to _Package-Based Rails Applications_ by Stephan Hagemann

This repository holds the source code used in my book on Package-based Rails Applications.

It is organized by chapter and section encoded as _cXs0Y_ for "Chapter X, Section Y." If a section adds no code that is
specific to it, it may use the source code from the last section preceding it that does have source code samples attached.

Because the Ruby and Rails ecosystems are moving so rapidly, creating a book about high-level structural concepts is
tough when underlying libraries constantly require subtle changes to the sample code. To this end, all source code packages its gem dependencies.

## What is this?

The main repository is available at <https://github.com/shageman/package-based-rails-applications-book>. This repository holds all the chapter code in separate branches so that the diffs between versions are more visible.
