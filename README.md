# Source Code to _Package-Based Rails Applications_ by Stephan Hagemann

This repository holds the source code used in my book on [Package-based Rails Applications](https://stephanhagemann.com/books/gradual-modularization). The main repository is available at <https://github.com/shageman/package-based-rails-applications-book>. This repository holds all the chapter code in separate branches so that the diffs between versions are more visible.

Because the Ruby and Rails ecosystems are moving so rapidly, creating a book about high-level structural concepts is
tough when underlying libraries constantly require subtle changes to the sample code. To this end, all source code packages its gem dependencies.
